    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>This week I am <b>extremely</b> excited about a new cooking technique called <q><dfn>sous vide</dfn></q>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <ref><i>Cooking for Geeks</i></ref>, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>

    <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
